Feature: Regular expressions in step definitions
  As a developer
  I want to see examples of regular expressions in step definitions
  So that I can write powerful Cucumber steps

  Scenario: Exact match
    Given I have a cucumber step

  Scenario: Non-capturing group
    Given I have a tasty cucumber step
    Given I have a nasty cucumber step
    Given I have a rusty cucumber step

  Scenario: Capture integers and strings
    Given I have 5 carrots in my basket
